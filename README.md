# ⚗️ SignAlchemist

SignAlchemist is an open-source web application designed to make physiological signal processing easy; nonetheless, any other signal can be processed.  
Its main aim is to be accessible to practitioners and researchers everywhere, providing a simple graphical user interface based on nodes for novice users, and more complex functionality for people with Python programming knowledge.  
The application has been designed with up-to-date web-based frameworks that make it responsive and easy to use on any device.

## ✨ Features (more to come!)

- **Resampling:** changes the sampling rate of the signal by using several interpolation techniques such as _spline_ or _interp1d_. This is useful when signals come from different sources or when they need to be normalized to a common frequency.
- **Filtering:** removes artefacts (_e.g._, noise, high-frequency...) using different filters including _Butterworth_, _Bessel_, _FIR_, and _Savitzky-Golay_. Parameters such as cutoff frequencies can be set based on user needs. Furthermore, users can create and customize their own filters using Python by following the instructions on the page.
- **Outlier detection:** identifies and removes unusual data that deviate significantly from the expected signal pattern. Techniques available include the _Hampel_ filter and IQR-based detection, aiming to improve signal quality without affecting legitimate variations.

# Installation

> **Important:**
> From now on, all paths and commands will use the `signalchemist` folder as the main project folder.

**SignAlchemist** uses Docker containers to simplify the installation and deployment process.

## 🐳 Environment Variables

Edit the environment variables file with:

```bash
nano .env
```

Example configuration:

```
VITE_BACKEND_PORT=     # Port where the backend server will run
FRONTEND_PORT=         # Port where the frontend will be accessible
PYTHON_ENABLED=        # Enable Python scripting support (true/false)
```

Three environment files are used depending on the context:

- **.env**: Default. Used only when neither `.env.dev` nor `.env.prod` are provided.
- **.env.dev**: Used for the development build.
- **.env.prod**: Used for the production build (Python scripting disabled).

## 🚧 Development Mode

To start the application in **development mode**, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.dev up --build
```

This will:

- Build and run the containers in development configuration.
- Use the settings from `.env.dev`.

**Important:** Don't forget the `--env-file` flag to load the correct environment variables.

Once the containers are running, you don't need to do anything else to access the application and its API — both will be available on the ports specified in the environment variables.

It’s also important to note that these ports are not only used in the `docker-compose.yml` files but also in the `vite.config.js` configuration:

```javascript
server: {
  watch: {
    usePolling: true,
  },
  host: true,
  strictPort: true,
  port: parseInt(process.env.FRONTEND_PORT || '5173'),
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: `http://backend:${process.env.VITE_BACKEND_PORT || '8000'}`,
      changeOrigin: true,
      rewrite: path => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''),
    },
  },
}
```

The **proxy** section is essential during development. It ensures that any request to `/api` from the frontend is forwarded to the backend container.
The `rewrite` function strips the `/api` prefix from the URL path before forwarding the request to the backend.

## 🚀 Production Mode

To launch the application in **production mode**, use:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up --build -d
```

This will:

- Run the app in detached mode (`-d`)
- Use `.env.prod` as the configuration

**Note:** In production mode, Python scripting must be disabled for security reasons.

## Production Architecture

In production, the application is composed of three containers:

1. **backend** – Runs the Python API using Uvicorn.
2. **frontend** – Serves the built static frontend files.
3. **nginx** – Acts as the single public entrypoint, routing all incoming traffic.

## Port Behavior

- `VITE_BACKEND_PORT` specifies the **internal port** used by the backend container.
- `FRONTEND_PORT` is the **host port** that maps to Nginx — this is the only port exposed to the outside world.
- The **frontend container** serves/listens on port `80` internally and is only accessed by Nginx.

So, when a user accesses the application via `http://localhost:<FRONTEND_PORT>` (whatever domain/IP), the request is actually handled by the Nginx container.

## Nginx Routing Logic

Nginx forwards requests based on their path:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://backend:8000/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://frontend:80;
    }
}
```

- Requests to `/api/` are forwarded to the backend container.
- All other requests (such as `/about` or `/filtering`) are routed to the frontend container.

> **Important:**  
> The value in `proxy_pass http://backend:8000/;` must match the backend port (`VITE_BACKEND_PORT`) defined in `.env.prod`.  
> If you change `VITE_BACKEND_PORT`, **you must update this Nginx config manually**.

It is up to the developer to set up an additional reverse proxy on the host machine if needed. For example, route `example.com` to its `localhost:<FRONTEND_PORT>`.

# Usage

After launching the containers, open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:<FRONTEND_PORT>
```

Replace `<FRONTEND_PORT>` with the actual port number you set in your `.env` file.

For example, if your `.env` file contains:

```
FRONTEND_PORT=5173
```

You can access the app at:

```
http://localhost:5173

```
