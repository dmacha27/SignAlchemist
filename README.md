# ‚öóÔ∏è SignAlchemist

SignAlchemist is an open-source web application designed to make physiological signal processing easy; nonetheless, any other signal can be processed.  
Its main aim is to be accessible to practitioners and researchers everywhere, providing a simple graphical user interface based on nodes for novice users, and more complex functionality for people with Python programming knowledge.  
The application has been designed with up-to-date web-based frameworks that make it responsive and easy to use on any device.

## ‚ú® Features (more to come!)

- **Resampling:** changes the sampling rate of the signal by using several interpolation techniques such as _spline_ or _interp1d_. This is useful when signals come from different sources or when they need to be normalized to a common frequency.
- **Filtering:** removes artefacts (_e.g._, noise, high-frequency...) using different filters including _Butterworth_, _Bessel_, _FIR_, and _Savitzky-Golay_. Parameters such as cutoff frequencies can be set based on user needs. Furthermore, users can create and customize their own filters using Python by following the instructions on the page.
- **Outlier detection:** identifies and removes unusual data that deviate significantly from the expected signal pattern. Techniques available include the _Hampel_ filter and IQR-based detection, aiming to improve signal quality without affecting legitimate variations.

# Installation

> **Important:**
> From now on, all paths and commands will use the `signalchemist` folder as the main project folder.

**SignAlchemist** uses Docker containers to simplify the installation and deployment process.

## üê≥ Environment Variables

Edit the environment variables file with:

```bash
nano .env
```

Example configuration:

```
VITE_BACKEND_PORT=     # Port where the backend server will run
FRONTEND_PORT=         # Port where the frontend will be accessible
PYTHON_ENABLED=        # Enable Python scripting support (true/false)
```

Three environment files are used depending on the context:

- **.env**: Default. Used only when neither `.env.dev` nor `.env.prod` are provided.
- **.env.dev**: Used for the development build.
- **.env.prod**: Used for the production build (Python scripting disabled).

## üöß Development Mode

To start the application in **development mode**, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.dev up --build
```

This will:

- Build and run the containers in development configuration.
- Use the settings from `.env.dev`.

**Important:** Don't forget the `--env-file` flag to load the correct environment variables.

Once the containers are running, you don't need to do anything else to access the application and its API ‚Äî both will be available on the ports specified in the environment variables.

It‚Äôs also important to note that these ports are not only used in the `docker-compose.yml` files but also in the `vite.config.js` configuration:

```javascript
server: {
  watch: {
    usePolling: true,
  },
  host: true,
  strictPort: true,
  port: parseInt(process.env.FRONTEND_PORT || '5173'),
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: `http://backend:${process.env.VITE_BACKEND_PORT || '8000'}`,
      changeOrigin: true,
      rewrite: path => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''),
    },
  },
}
```

The **proxy** section is essential during development. It ensures that any request to `/api` from the frontend is forwarded to the backend container.
The `rewrite` function strips the `/api` prefix from the URL path before forwarding the request to the backend.

## üöÄ Production Mode

To launch the application in **production mode**, use:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up --build -d
```

This will:

- Run the app in detached mode (`-d`)
- Use `.env.prod` as the configuration

**Note:** In production mode, Python scripting must be disabled for security reasons.

## Production Architecture

In production, the application is composed of three containers:

1. **backend** ‚Äì Runs the Python API using Uvicorn.
2. **frontend** ‚Äì Serves the built static frontend files.
3. **nginx** ‚Äì Acts as the single public entrypoint, routing all incoming traffic.

## Port Behavior

- `VITE_BACKEND_PORT` specifies the **internal port** used by the backend container.
- `FRONTEND_PORT` is the **host port** that maps to Nginx ‚Äî this is the only port exposed to the outside world.
- The **frontend container** serves/listens on port `80` internally and is only accessed by Nginx.

So, when a user accesses the application via `http://localhost:<FRONTEND_PORT>` (whatever domain/IP), the request is actually handled by the Nginx container.

## Nginx Routing Logic

Nginx forwards requests based on their path:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://backend:8000/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://frontend:80;
    }
}
```

- Requests to `/api/` are forwarded to the backend container.
- All other requests (such as `/about` or `/filtering`) are routed to the frontend container.

> **Important:**  
> The value in `proxy_pass http://backend:8000/;` must match the backend port (`VITE_BACKEND_PORT`) defined in `.env.prod`.  
> If you change `VITE_BACKEND_PORT`, **you must update this Nginx config manually**.

It is up to the developer to set up an additional reverse proxy on the host machine if needed. For example, route `example.com` to its `localhost:<FRONTEND_PORT>`.

# Usage

After launching the containers, open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:<FRONTEND_PORT>
```

Replace `<FRONTEND_PORT>` with the actual port number you set in your `.env` file.

For example, if your `.env` file contains:

```
FRONTEND_PORT=5173
```

You can access the app at:

```
http://localhost:5173

```
